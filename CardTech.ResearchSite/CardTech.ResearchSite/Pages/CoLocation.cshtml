                    UofL’s main Belknap Campus sits just south of downtown in the area of historic Old Louisville. This park-like campus is 287 acres, and is home to seven of our 12 academic colleges, including the J.B. Speed School of Engineering, Louis D. Brandeis School of Law and College of Arts and Sciences.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Belknap is also home to our world-class sports facilities, including Cardinal Stadium for football, Owsley B. Frazier Cardinal Park for softball, Cardinal Track and Soccer Stadium, Bass-Rudd Tennis Center and the Jim Patterson baseball stadium. This campus is also where you will find our well-stocked Ekstrom Library, newly-renovated Speed Art Museum and our famous cast of Auguste Rodin's The Thinker statue.
