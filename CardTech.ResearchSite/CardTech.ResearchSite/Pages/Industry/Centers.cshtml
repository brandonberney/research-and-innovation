                The UofL and its Health Partners serve a highly diverse patient population, including many underrepresented and medical underserved groups. Our overall goals are to develop a collaborative clinical and translational research infrastructure across Kentucky and with partnering IDeA CTRs (Clinical and Translational Resources) and CTSAs (Clinical and Translational Science Awards) that will positively impact the health outcomes; and to develop an interactive professional development program that will create a pipeline for the next generation of clinical and translational investigators. This us achieved these goals through four aims:
                <br />
                <br />
                1. Expand and fully integrate the “academic home” for clinical and translational research (CTR).
                <br />
                2. Create a multidisciplinary program in research training, education and career development, including utilizing advanced degrees to train the next generation of clinical and translational investigators.
                <br />
                3. Develop Key Component Activities (KCA) that provide the necessary clinical research resources and translational technologies to create novel, clinical and translational research.
                <br />
                4. Support community and academic scientists/educators to fully engage with the unique and highly diverse population of Kentucky in research, health care and medical advances to reduce chronic diseases and improve the overall health/well being of Kentuckians.Support community and academic scientists/educators to fully engage with the unique and highly diverse population of Kentucky in research, health care and medical advances to reduce chronic diseases and improve the overall health/well being of Kentuckians.

                The mission of the KRSIRC is to develop successful spinal cord repair strategies in the laboratory that can be taken to the clinic in a timely and responsible fashion. The Center's growth has been made possible by funding and excellent cooperation between the State of Kentucky, University of Louisville, Norton Healthcare, and a recent $5.5 million grant from NIH. KSCIRC is in a unique position to conduct research that, through our close association with our clinical colleagues in the Department of Neurological Surgery, we expect will ultimately lead to effective treatments for spinal cord injury. This goal will be facilitated by our plan to double the size and scientific impact of the Center over the next five years.
